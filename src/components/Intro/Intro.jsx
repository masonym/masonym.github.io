                    I'm from the Greater Vancouver area, and eager to join a talented team building exciting products.

                    I write code, mostly with TypeScript and Next.js, and I love building things that real humans use! I'd love to expand my skill set and learn from others in the industry. I've spent a while learning the "safe" stuff like React, Next.js, and TypeScript, but I'm eager to move outside of the box.
